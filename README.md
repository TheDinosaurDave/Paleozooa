Basically, im trying to make an extinct animal version of metazooa. 
And i have the basics working, but for the life of me everything beyond where i am at is above my skill level.
What i want is a page setup similarly to the guessing game metazooa (how it shows a growing tree of life as you guess and has a visual link to the tier you  are at at that point in the game), that i can throw the data i have already sorted into.
As a bonus i would also like to convert the data into a searchable tree of life type thingy. 
I have a proof of concept version of both those pages setup, and a document with just the animal data in it in my google drive.
What i would like is to make it a full interactive website like metazooa and the interactive tree as a teaching aid.
If these ramblings make sense to you and you want to help, or know of some tutorials thatll help me, then let me know.
I feel like im going insane here haha
Here are the things im referencing
Metazooa - https://metazooa.com/
Interactive tree of life - https://www.onezoom.org/life/
My drive with the WIP files in it, the trick to the game is to use the branching tree file as a guide for what your next guess should be - https://drive.google.com/.../1ZiS4MfUOMeZdL5W9iH...
